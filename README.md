## IEX Cloud API
Program was build using the sandbox version of IEX Cloud API. IEX Cloud provides all accounts a free, unlimited use sandbox for testing. Every account will be assigned two test tokens available via the Console. 

Please note that sandbox response data is purposefully manipulated to scramble values and is not suitable for production usage. Data returned in the sandbox will look real, but strings are scrambled, dates are maniuplated, and numbers are changed.
